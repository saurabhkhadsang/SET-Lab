Q 4. Differentiate in between GitHub, Git and GitLab.
Git is a tool that helps you keep track of changes you make to your code, so you can go back to earlier versions if needed. 
GitHub is a website that lets you store and share your code with others, using Git.
GitLab is similar to GitHub, but it also has some extra features for managing your code and working with a team.

Q 5. What is version control? Explain with example. 
Version control is a system for keeping track of different versions of your code. It's like a big notebook where you can write down all the changes you make, so you can look back at older versions later. This is helpful when you're working with other people, or when you want to try out a new idea without ruining your original code.
